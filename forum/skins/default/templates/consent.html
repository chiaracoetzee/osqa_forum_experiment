<p>Dear {{ username }}:</p>

<p>During this course, course staff at University of California,
Berkeley will be evaluating a new forum software called OSQA that is
similar to StackOverflow. This software has several features that
standard edX forum software does not, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>A reputation score associated which each user, based primarily on
the number of upvotes they receive on their questions and
answers.</li>
<li>Privileges, in which users acquire the ability to perform new
technical actions, such as editing other's posts, as they acquire more
reputation.</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be two forums, one that has these features and one that
only has basic forum features, and you will be randomly assigned to
one.  This is not an experiment, but is being used to evaluate the
software setup for a future experiment. Content and time of posts will
be available to the general public, but no other private information
will be recorded.</p>

<p>If you consent to participate in this evaluation, please click "Accept"
below. If you prefer to use the old, standard edX forum software, please
click "Go to standard edX forum."</p>

<p><a href="accept/">Accept</a></p>
