'''
This python module implements a library of features to be extracted from the MOOC forum.
The intent is that any script in need of features should be able to ask this library for
the required feature, and this module will access the database to retrieve the feature for
all the students/forum-threads.

The features currently implemented are:
-

The features that need to be implemented are:
- Number of questions asked for each student
- Number of answers posted for each student
- Number of overall posts for each student
- Number of posts viewed for each student
- Number of upvotes/downvotes for each student
- Whether each student modified their profile
- Average time between posts for each student
